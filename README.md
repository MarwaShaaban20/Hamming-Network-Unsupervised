# Hamming-Network-Unsupervised
## Steps in my code
1) Implementation of PCA from scratch (contains implementation of covariance matrix and implementation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors using power iteration mwthod).
2) Prprocessing the mnist dataset making it only zeros and ones to apply the hamming network later on it.
3) Tring different number of components in PCA till gets best result.
4) Cluster data using k-means (you can use any clustering technique
